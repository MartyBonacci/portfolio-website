		<h1>Purpose:</h1>
			<p>I would like my PWP to serve as a portfolio of my past work and enable visitors to easily get in contact with me.</p>
		<h1>Audience:</h1>
			<p>My target audience with this portfolio website is future freelance clients.</p>
		<h1>Goal:</h1>
			<p>The primary goal of this website is to generate leads from freelance clients after I graduate from bootcamp. </p>
		<h1>Persona:</h1>
		<p>An example persona of someone in my primary target audience is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Debi is 60 years old and is transitioning towards retiring from her job as a paralegal. As a way to make money in retirement, Debi is opening a consulting business to offer her paralegal expertise to law firms on a part time, contract basis. Debi is comfortable using her Asus laptop and iPhone, but doesn't consider herself particularly techincally savvy. She feels overwhelmed at the prospect of creating a website for her new business on her own. Debi's goal of creating a website is to have a landing page for future clients of her own to be able to get in touch with her. She would prefer to work with someone to make updates to her website, versus having to learn and manage her site on her own.</li>
					<li>Debi finds out about Erin's ability to make websites at a networking event, and goes to Erin's portfolio page to see some examples of her past work. She decides that she wants to talk further with Erin about hiring her to work on a website for her new paralegal consulting business. Debi submits her information via the contact form on Erin's site requesting a quote for the project.</li>
				</ul>
