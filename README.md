My Personal Website Project (PWP) is a portfolio website to demonstrate my work to potential clients. 

## Milestone 1 Feedback
This is a good start and overall direction for your PWP project. Your project is set up according to spec, and your HTML looks good overall.

The user interface and visual design of your site will be important in conveying a positive impression upon your leads. During your wireframing process, consider what information and/or "calls to action" you may want to feature prominently that could facilitate a good conversion rate. Might the mobile layout need to be a bit different from the desktop layout, and how so? What will resonate with the kind of clients you are interested in working with? Every PWP will require a contact form, but do you also have other outlets like social media or mailing lists that you might want to incorporate too? 

A few of the things I mentioned above really veer off into territory that is not covered in this class like design and marketing, but your UI and content strategy are certainly relevant to your development process ahead. We're keeping the scope very narrow, so it may help to think of this as just an experimental go-round with your online presence and development process. As a freelancer, your website needs will likely expand beyond this tiny project after graduation. I suggest continuing to work with Daniel Heron on developing and refining the marketing aspects to support your freelance career goals.

Nice job. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Good idea to kill any "dead code" that's left behind - that means deleting the commented-out code that's leftover.
- Watch HTML indentation. This becomes more important as the document becomes more complex. If the indentation is correct and accurate, building and debugging pages becomes much easier.
